    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large;">
        The Laws of Badminton <br>
        The Laws of Badminton and Competition Regulations in the BWF Statutes provide the detail on every aspect of
        the game of badminton.<br>

        Below is a brief overview - simplified rules.<br>

        Scoring System<br>

        A match consists of the best of 3 games of 21 points.<br>
        Every time there is a serve - there is a point scored.<br>
        The side winning a rally adds a point to its score.<br>
        At 20 all, the side which gains a 2 point lead first, wins that game.<br>
        At 29 all, the side scoring the 30th point, wins that game.<br>
        The side winning a game serves first in the next game.<br>
        Interval and Change of Ends
        When the leading score reaches 11 points, players have a 60 second interval.<br>
        A 2 minute interval between each game is allowed.<br>
        In the third game, players change ends when the leading score reaches 11 points.<br>
        Singles
        At the beginning of the game (0-0) and when the server's score is even, the server serves from the right
        service court. When the server's score is odd, the server serves from the left service court.<br>
        If the server wins a rally, the server scores a point and then serves again from the alternate service
        court.<br>
        If the receiver wins a rally, the receiver scores a point and becomes the new server. They serve from the
        appropriate service court - left if their score is odd, and right if it is even.<br>

        Doubles
        A side has only one 'set'.<br>
        The service passes consecutively to the players as shown in the diagram.<br>
        At the beginning of the game and when the score is even, the server serves from the right service court.
        When it is odd, the server serves from the left court.<br>
        If the serving side wins a rally, the serving side scores a point and the same server serves again from the
        alternate service court.<br>
        If the receiving side wins a rally, the receiving side scores a point. The receiving side becomes the new
        serving side.<br>
        The players do not change their respective service courts until they win a point when their side is serving.
        If players commit an error in the service court, the error is corrected when the mistake is discovered.<br>

        In a doubles match between A & B against C & D. A & B won the toss and decided to serve. A to serve to C. A
        shall be the initial server while C shall be the initial receiver.<br>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;" id="basketball">Basketball</h1><br><br>

    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large;">
        On 15 January 1892, James Naismith published his rules for the game of "Basket Ball" that he invented:[1]
        The original game played under these rules was quite different from the one played today as there was no
        dribbling, dunking, three-pointers, or shot clock, and goal tending was legal.<br>

        The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.<br>
        The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never with fist).<br>
        A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance
        to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at a good speed.<br>
        The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it.<br>
        No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be
        allowed.<br> The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul; the second shall
        disqualify him until the next goal is made or, if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the
        whole of the game.<br> No substitute allowed.<br>
        A foul is striking at the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such described in rule 5.<br>
        If either side makes three consecutive fouls, it shall count a goal for the opponents (consecutive means
        without the opponents in the meantime making a foul).<br>
        A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there
        (without falling), providing those defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal.<br> If the ball rests on
        the edge, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal.<br>
        When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and played by the first person touching
        it.<br> In case of dispute the umpire shall throw it straight into the field.<br> The thrower in is allowed five
        seconds, if he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent.<br> If any side persists in delaying the game, the
        umpire shall call a foul on them.<br>
        The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls, and notify the referee when three
        consecutive fouls have been made.<br> He shall have power to disqualify people according to Rule 5.<br>
        The referee shall be judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which side
        it belongs, and shall keep the time.<br> He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals
        with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.<br>
        The time shall be two fifteen minute halves, with five minutes rest between.<br>
        The side making the most goals in that time is declared the winner.<br> In case of a drew game may, by agreement
        of the captain, by continued until another goal is made.<br>
        Naismith's original 1892 manuscript of the rules of basketball, one of the most expensive manuscripts in
        existence, is publicly displayed at Allen Fieldhouse on the campus of the University of Kansas.<br> Naismith was
        the first coach in the history of Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball.<br>

        Players, substitutes, teams and teammates
        Naismith's original rules did not specify how many players were to be on the court.<br> In 1900, five players
        became standard, and players that were substituted were not allowed to re-enter the game.<br>[citation needed]
        Players were allowed to re-enter a game once from 1921, and twice from 1934; such restrictions on
        substitutions were abolished in 1945 when substitutions became unlimited.<br> Coaching was originally prohibited
        during the game, but from 1949, coaches were allowed to address players during a time-out.<br>

        Originally a player was disqualified on his second foul.<br> This limit became four fouls in 1911 and five fouls
        in 1945, still the case in most forms of basketball where the normal length of the game (before any overtime
        periods) is 40 minutes.<br> When the normal length is 48 minutes (this is the case with the National Basketball
        Association in the United States and Canada) a player is accordingly disqualified on his sixth foul.<br>

            The basic field hockey rules. <br>
            Hockey players can only hit the ball with the flat side of their stick.<br>

            control the ball at any time.<br>
            A goal can only be scored either from a field goal, a penalty corner, or from a penalty stroke. A field goal
            is
            a goal scored from open play, and can only be scored from inside the 'striking circle', in front of the
            opponent's goal. If the hockey ball is hit from outside the circle and goes into the goal, it does not count
            as
            a goal.<br>
            Hockey players may not trip, push, charge, interfere with, or physically handle an opponent in any way.
            Hockey
            is a non-contact sport and all fouls result in a free hit or a 'penalty corner' for the non-offending team
            depending on where the infringement took place and the severity of the foul.<br>
            Types of foul in field hockey
            A number of different types of foul may be punished in a game of hockey. Some of the basic ones to watch out
            for
            include.<br>

            Obstruction. This is awarded against a hockey player who uses their body or stick to prevent an opponent
            from
            reaching the ball.<br>
            Third-party obstruction. This is awarded when a hockey player positions themselves between the ball and an
            opponent, allowing a team-mate an unobstructed play on the ball.<br>
            Advancing. This is awarded against a player who shoves, pushes, or advances the ball in any way, using any
            part
            of their body.<br>
            Backsticks. This is awarded against a player who strikes the ball with the rounded back of the hockey stick.
            Hockey stick interference. This is awarded against a player who uses their stick to hit an opponent's stick,
            either intentionally or unintentionally.<br>
            Undercutting. This is awarded against a player who lifts the ball in a dangerous manner.<br>
            Sticks. This is awarded against a player who raises their stick dangerously near another player.<br>
            Types of punishment in field hockey
            Fouls in a hockey match can be punished in three main ways. These are as follows:<br>

            Free hit. This is a free play awarded on any offenses that occurs outside of the scoring circle. It usually
            takes place at the location of the violation. All opposing players must stand at least 5 yards (4.6m) from
            where
            the hit is to be taken.<br>
            Penalty corner. This is awarded to the attacking team when the defense either commits a foul inside the
            striking
            circle or intentionally hits the ball out-of-bounds over the end line. A penalty corner is taken by an
            attacking
            player at a spot on the end-line 10 yards (9.2m) away from the nearest goal post. All other attackers must
            stand
            outside the striking circle, while five defenders, including the goalkeeper, stand behind the end line until
            contact is made with the ball. Once the ball has been put in play, all players can rush into the circle to
            either defend or shoot the ball at the goal.<br>
            Penalty stroke. This is awarded to the attacking side when an offense is committed by the defending side
            which
            is deemed to have prevented an almost certain goal. A penalty is taken 7 yards (6.4m) from goal, with the
            player
            having only the goalkeeper to beat.<br>
            Field hockey umpires
            There are two umpires on the hockey field, who are usually responsible for each half of the pitch. A player
            who
            breaches the rules, either by rough or dangerous play, misconduct, or an intentional offenses, can be shown
            a
            card — either green, yellow or red.<br>

            Green. This is an official warning given to the hockey player to not break the rules.<br>
            Yellow. This results in a hockey player being sent off the pitch for 5 minutes, following an offense.<br>
            Red. A red card results in an early shower and is given for more serious offense.

            Sprinters should run in designated lanes and cannot cross lanes, throughout the race.<br>

            In races with bunched starts, athletes can break inside.<br> In 800-meter race, they start from staggered
            positions and can break inside after the first bend.<br>

            In longer races of 1500 meters, 5000 meters, and 10000 meters, athletes can break inside after the start.<br>

            Sprinters shouldn't step on white lines that mark their lanes throughout the race.<br>

            Sensors are placed in the starting pistol and at the blocks.<br> In case of a false start, the athlete is
            disqualified.<br>

            Before giving the 'set' command or before firing the starter gun, athletes cannot touch the other side of
            the start line with their hands or feet.<br>

            Athletes should not obstruct other athletes during the race.<br>

            If an athlete is obstructed, the referee may order the race to be held again, or he may ask the athlete to
            take part in the next round.<br>

            Athletes may leave the track voluntarily before the race ends, but they cannot come back to the track else

    <h1 style="text-align: center;" id="volleyball">Volleyball</h1><br><br>

    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large;">
        The court dimensions

        A volleyball court is 9 m × 18 m (29.5 ft × 59.1 ft), divided into equal square halves by a net with a width
        of one meter (39.4 in).[18]<br> The top of the net is 2.43 m (7 ft 11+11⁄16 in) above the center of the court
        for men's competition, and 2.24 m (7 ft 4+3⁄16 in) for women's competition, varied for veterans and junior
        competitions.[3]<br>

        The minimum height clearance for indoor volleyball courts is 7 m (23.0 ft), although a clearance of 8 m
        (26.2 ft) is recommended.[18]<br>

        A line 3 m (9.8 ft) from and parallel to the net is considered the "attack line". This "3 meter" (or
        "10-foot") line divides the court into "back row" and "front row" areas (also back court and front
        court).[18]<br> These are in turn divided into 3 areas each: these are numbered as follows, starting from area
        "1", which is the position of the serving player:

        After a team gains the serve (also known as siding out), its members must rotate in a clockwise direction,
        with the player previously in area "2" moving to area "1" and so on, with the player from area "1" moving to
        area "6".[3]<br> Each player rotates only one time after the team gains possession of the service; the next time
        each player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the ball and loses the point.[18]<br>

        The team courts are surrounded by an area called the free zone which is a minimum of 3 meters wide and which
        the players may enter and play within after the service of the ball.[19]<br> All lines denoting the boundaries
        of the team court and the attack zone are drawn or painted within the dimensions of the area and are
        therefore a part of the court or zone. If a ball comes in contact with the line, the ball is considered to
        be "in". An antenna is placed on each side of the net perpendicular to the sideline and is a vertical
        extension of the side boundary of the court. A ball passing over the net must pass completely between the
        antennae (or their theoretical extensions to the ceiling) without contacting them.[3]<br>

        The ball:
        Main article: Volleyball (ball)
        FIVB regulations state that the ball must be spherical, made of leather or synthetic leather, have a
        circumference of 65–67 cm (26–26 in), a weight of 260–280 g (9.2–9.9 oz) and an interior air pressure of
        0.30–0.325 kg/cm2 (4.26 to 4.61 psi)(294.3 to 318.82 mbar or hPa).[20]<br> Other governing bodies have similar
        regulations.

        Gameplay:
        Each team consists of six players.[18]<br> To get play started, a team is chosen to serve by coin toss. A player
        from the serving team throws the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the net on
        a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court (the serve).[18]<br> The opposing team must use a
        combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the opponent's side of
        the net.[18]<br> These contacts usually consist first of the bump or pass so that the ball's trajectory is aimed
        towards the player designated as the setter; second of the set (usually an over-hand pass using wrists to
        push finger-tips at the ball) by the setter so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one
        of the players designated as an attacker can hit it, and third by the attacker who spikes (jumping, raising
        one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent's
        court) to return the ball over the net.[3]<br> The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the
        ball as described is said to be on offence.

        The team on defence attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court: players at
        the net jump and reach above the top (and if possible, across the plane) of the net to block the attacked
        ball.[3]<br> If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive players arranged in the rest
        of the court attempt to control the ball with a dig (usually a fore-arm pass of a hard-driven ball). After a
        successful dig, the team transitions to offence.

        The game continues in this manner, rallying back and forth until the ball touches the court within the
        boundaries or until an error is made.[18]<br> The most frequent errors that are made are either to fail to
        return the ball over the net within the allowed three touches, or to cause the ball to land outside the
        court.[18]<br> A ball is "in" if any part of it touches the inside of a team's court or a sideline or end-line,
        and a strong spike may compress the ball enough when it lands that a ball which at first appears to be going
        out may actually be in. Players may travel well outside the court to play a ball that has gone over a
        sideline or end-line in the air.

        Other common errors include a player touching the ball twice in succession, a player "catching" the ball, a
        player touching the net while attempting to play the ball, or a player penetrating under the net into the
        opponent's court. There are a large number of other errors specified in the rules, although most of them are
        infrequent occurrences. These errors include back-row or libero players spiking the ball or blocking
        (back-row players may spike the ball if they jump from behind the attack line), players not being in the
        correct position when the ball is served, attacking the serve in the frontcourt and above the height of the
        net, using another player as a source of support to reach the ball, stepping over the back boundary line
        when serving, taking more than 8 seconds to serve,[21]<br> or playing the ball when it is above the opponent's
        court.

        Scoring:
        A point is scored when the ball contacts the floor within the court boundaries or when an error is made:
        when the ball strikes one team's side of the court, the other team gains a point; and when an error is made,
        the team that did not make the error is awarded a point, in either case paying no regard to whether they
        served the ball or not. If any part of the ball hits the line, the ball is counted as in the court. The team
        that won the point serves for the next point. If the team that won the point served in the previous point,
        the same player serves again. If the team that won the point did not serve the previous point, the players
        of the team acquiring the serve rotate their position on the court in a clockwise manner. The game
        continues, with the first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin awarded the set. Matches are
        best-of-five sets and the fifth set, if necessary, is usually played to 15 points. (Scoring differs between
        leagues, tournaments, and levels; high schools sometimes play best-of-three to 25; in the NCAA matches are
        played best-of-five to 25 as of the 2008 season.)[22]<br>

        Before 1999, points could be scored only when a team had the serve (side-out scoring) and all sets went up
        to only 15 points. The FIVB changed the rules in 1999 (with the changes being compulsory in 2000) to use the
        current scoring system (formerly known as rally point system), primarily to make the length of the match
        more predictable and to make the game more spectator- and television-friendly.

        The final year of side-out scoring at the NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Championship was 2000. Rally
        point scoring debuted in 2001,[23]<br> and games were played to 30 points through 2007. For the 2008 season,
        games were renamed "sets" and reduced to 25 points to win. Most high schools in the U.S. changed to rally
        scoring in 2003,[24]<br>[25]<br>[26]<br> and several states implemented it the previous year on an experimental
        basis.[27]<br>

        Libero
        The libero player was introduced internationally in 1998,[28]<br> and made its debut for NCAA competition in
        2002.[29]<br> The libero is a player specialized in defensive skills: the libero must wear a contrasting jersey
        color from their teammates and cannot block or attack the ball when it is entirely above net height. When
        the ball is not in play, the libero can replace any back-row player, without prior notice to the officials.
        This replacement does not count against the substitution limit each team is allowed per set, although the
        libero may be replaced only by the player whom he or she replaced. Most U.S. high schools added the libero
        position from 2003 to 2005.[25]<br>[30]<br>

        The modern-day libero often takes on the role of a second setter. When the setter digs the ball, the libero
        is typically responsible for the second ball and sets to the front row attacker. The libero may function as
        a setter only under certain restrictions. To make an overhand set, the libero must be standing behind (and
        not stepping on) the 3-meter line; otherwise, the ball cannot be attacked above the net in front of the
        3-meter line. An underhand pass is allowed from any part of the court.

        The libero is, generally, the most skilled defensive player on the team. There is also a libero tracking
        sheet, where the referees or officiating team must keep track of whom the libero subs in and out for. Under
        FIVB (Federation Internationale de Volleyball) rules, two liberos are designated at the beginning of the
        play, only one of whom can be on the court at any time.

        Furthermore, a libero is not allowed to serve, according to international rules. NCAA rules for both men and
        women differ on this point; a 2004 rule change allows the libero to serve, but only in a specific rotation.
        That is, the libero can only serve for one person, not for all of the people for whom he or she goes in.
        That rule change was also applied to high school and junior high play soon after.

        Recent rule changes
        Other rule changes enacted in 2000 include allowing serves in which the ball touches the net, as long as it
        goes over the net into the opponents' court. Also, the service area was expanded to allow players to serve
        from anywhere behind the end line but still within the theoretical extension of the sidelines. Other changes
        were made to lighten up calls on faults for carries and double-touches, such as allowing multiple contacts
        by a single player ("double-hits") on a team's first contact provided that they are a part of a single play
        on the ball.

        In 2008, the NCAA changed the minimum number of points needed to win any of the first four sets from 30 to
        25 for women's volleyball (men's volleyball remained at 30 for another three years, switching to 25 in
        2011). If a fifth (deciding) set is reached, the minimum required score remains at 15. In addition, the word
        "game" is now referred to as "set".[22]<br>

        The Official Volleyball Rules are prepared and updated every few years by the FIVB's Rules of the Game and
        Refereeing Commission.[31]<br> The latest edition is usually available on the FIVB's website.[2]<br>

    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large;">
        Rules and scoring in weightlifting
        There are two stages in modern Olympic weightlifting – the ‘snatch’ and the ‘clean and jerk’.<br>

        The snatch is where the weightlifter picks up the barbell and lifts it above his head in one singular
        motion.<br>

        In the clean and jerk, the weightlifter is first required to pick up the barbell and bring it up to his
        chest (clean).<br> The lifter must then pause and extend his arms and legs to lift it above the head (jerk) with
        a straight elbow and have to hold it there until a buzzer is sounded.<br>

        A weightlifter is given three snatch attempts and three clean and jerk attempts each.<br> A weightlifter’s best
        attempt at snatch and the clean and jerk are then added up and the one with the highest combined weight
        lifted is declared the winner.<br>

        In case two participants have lifted the same combined weight, then the one with the lower bodyweight is
        declared the winner.<br> In the event of the bodyweight also being equal, the one with lesser attempts will be
        the winner.<br>

        A participant is allowed to increase the weight for his next attempt after a successful lift.<br> The one who
        decides to lift the lowest weight in the first attempt is allowed to go first and he must attempt to lift
        within one minute of his name being called out in any tournament.<br>

        The barbell is made of steel and the heavy weights, covered with rubber, are added to the sides.<br>

        Weightlifters are allowed to use tapes to cover parts of their body – like the wrists and thumbs – to
        prevent injury.<br> They also often rub chalk on their hands to make it dry before a lift, which prevents the
        barbell from slipping.<br>
