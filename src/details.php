  The Laws of Badminton <br>
  The Laws of Badminton and Competition Regulations in the BWF Statutes provide the detail on every aspect of
  the game of badminton.<br>

  Below is a brief overview - simplified rules.<br>

  Scoring System<br>

  A match consists of the best of 3 games of 21 points.<br>
  Every time there is a serve - there is a point scored.<br>
  The side winning a rally adds a point to its score.<br>
  At 20 all, the side which gains a 2 point lead first, wins that game.<br>
  At 29 all, the side scoring the 30th point, wins that game.<br>
  The side winning a game serves first in the next game.<br>
  Interval and Change of Ends
  When the leading score reaches 11 points, players have a 60 second interval.<br>
  A 2 minute interval between each game is allowed.<br>
  In the third game, players change ends when the leading score reaches 11 points.<br>
  Singles
  At the beginning of the game (0-0) and when the server's score is even, the server serves from the right
  service court. When the server's score is odd, the server serves from the left service court.<br>
  If the server wins a rally, the server scores a point and then serves again from the alternate service
  court.<br>
  If the receiver wins a rally, the receiver scores a point and becomes the new server. They serve from the
  appropriate service court - left if their score is odd, and right if it is even.<br>

  Doubles
  A side has only one 'set'.<br>
  The service passes consecutively to the players as shown in the diagram.<br>
  At the beginning of the game and when the score is even, the server serves from the right service court.
  When it is odd, the server serves from the left court.<br>
  If the serving side wins a rally, the serving side scores a point and the same server serves again from the
  alternate service court.<br>
  If the receiving side wins a rally, the receiving side scores a point. The receiving side becomes the new
  serving side.<br>
  The players do not change their respective service courts until they win a point when their side is serving.
  If players commit an error in the service court, the error is corrected when the mistake is discovered.<br>

  In a doubles match between A & B against C & D. A & B won the toss and decided to serve. A to serve to C. A
  shall be the initial server while C shall be the initial receiver.<br>";

  $gameDetail="
  On 15 January 1892, James Naismith published his rules for the game of 'Basket Ball' that he invented:[1]
        The original game played under these rules was quite different from the one played today as there was no
        dribbling, dunking, three-pointers, or shot clock, and goal tending was legal.<br>

        The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.<br>
        The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never with fist).<br>
        A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance
        to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at a good speed.<br>
        The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it.<br>
        No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be
        allowed.<br> The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul; the second shall
        disqualify him until the next goal is made or, if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the
        whole of the game.<br> No substitute allowed.<br>
        A foul is striking at the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such described in rule 5.<br>
        If either side makes three consecutive fouls, it shall count a goal for the opponents (consecutive means
        without the opponents in the meantime making a foul).<br>
        A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there
        (without falling), providing those defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal.<br> If the ball rests on
        the edge, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal.<br>
        When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and played by the first person touching
        it.<br> In case of dispute the umpire shall throw it straight into the field.<br> The thrower in is allowed five
        seconds, if he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent.<br> If any side persists in delaying the game, the
        umpire shall call a foul on them.<br>
        The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls, and notify the referee when three
        consecutive fouls have been made.<br> He shall have power to disqualify people according to Rule 5.<br>
        The referee shall be judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which side
        it belongs, and shall keep the time.<br> He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals
        with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.<br>
        The time shall be two fifteen minute halves, with five minutes rest between.<br>
        The side making the most goals in that time is declared the winner.<br> In case of a drew game may, by agreement
        of the captain, by continued until another goal is made.<br>
        Naismith's original 1892 manuscript of the rules of basketball, one of the most expensive manuscripts in
        existence, is publicly displayed at Allen Fieldhouse on the campus of the University of Kansas.<br> Naismith was
        the first coach in the history of Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball.<br>

        Players, substitutes, teams and teammates
        Naismith's original rules did not specify how many players were to be on the court.<br> In 1900, five players
        became standard, and players that were substituted were not allowed to re-enter the game.<br>[citation needed]
        Players were allowed to re-enter a game once from 1921, and twice from 1934; such restrictions on
        substitutions were abolished in 1945 when substitutions became unlimited.<br> Coaching was originally prohibited
        during the game, but from 1949, coaches were allowed to address players during a time-out.<br>

        Originally a player was disqualified on his second foul.<br> This limit became four fouls in 1911 and five fouls
        in 1945, still the case in most forms of basketball where the normal length of the game (before any overtime
        periods) is 40 minutes.<br> When the normal length is 48 minutes (this is the case with the National Basketball
        Association in the United States and Canada) a player is accordingly disqualified on his sixth foul.<br>";

  $gameDetail="
  The basic field hockey rules. <br>
            Hockey players can only hit the ball with the flat side of their stick.<br>
            Hockey players (other than the goalkeeper) are not allowed to use their feet, or any other parts of the
            body, to
            control the ball at any time.<br>
            A goal can only be scored either from a field goal, a penalty corner, or from a penalty stroke. A field goal
            is
            a goal scored from open play, and can only be scored from inside the 'striking circle', in front of the
            opponent's goal. If the hockey ball is hit from outside the circle and goes into the goal, it does not count
            as
            a goal.<br>
            Hockey players may not trip, push, charge, interfere with, or physically handle an opponent in any way.
            Hockey
            is a non-contact sport and all fouls result in a free hit or a 'penalty corner' for the non-offending team
            depending on where the infringement took place and the severity of the foul.<br>
            Types of foul in field hockey
            A number of different types of foul may be punished in a game of hockey. Some of the basic ones to watch out
            for
            include.<br>

            Obstruction. This is awarded against a hockey player who uses their body or stick to prevent an opponent
            from
            reaching the ball.<br>
            Third-party obstruction. This is awarded when a hockey player positions themselves between the ball and an
            opponent, allowing a team-mate an unobstructed play on the ball.<br>
            Advancing. This is awarded against a player who shoves, pushes, or advances the ball in any way, using any
            part
            of their body.<br>
            Backsticks. This is awarded against a player who strikes the ball with the rounded back of the hockey stick.
            Hockey stick interference. This is awarded against a player who uses their stick to hit an opponent's stick,
            either intentionally or unintentionally.<br>
            Undercutting. This is awarded against a player who lifts the ball in a dangerous manner.<br>
            Sticks. This is awarded against a player who raises their stick dangerously near another player.<br>
            Types of punishment in field hockey
            Fouls in a hockey match can be punished in three main ways. These are as follows:<br>

            Free hit. This is a free play awarded on any offenses that occurs outside of the scoring circle. It usually
            takes place at the location of the violation. All opposing players must stand at least 5 yards (4.6m) from
            where
            the hit is to be taken.<br>
            Penalty corner. This is awarded to the attacking team when the defense either commits a foul inside the
            striking
            circle or intentionally hits the ball out-of-bounds over the end line. A penalty corner is taken by an
            attacking
            player at a spot on the end-line 10 yards (9.2m) away from the nearest goal post. All other attackers must
            stand
            outside the striking circle, while five defenders, including the goalkeeper, stand behind the end line until
            contact is made with the ball. Once the ball has been put in play, all players can rush into the circle to
            either defend or shoot the ball at the goal.<br>
            Penalty stroke. This is awarded to the attacking side when an offense is committed by the defending side
            which
            is deemed to have prevented an almost certain goal. A penalty is taken 7 yards (6.4m) from goal, with the
            player
            having only the goalkeeper to beat.<br>
            Field hockey umpires
            There are two umpires on the hockey field, who are usually responsible for each half of the pitch. A player
            who
            breaches the rules, either by rough or dangerous play, misconduct, or an intentional offenses, can be shown
            a
            card — either green, yellow or red.<br>

            Green. This is an official warning given to the hockey player to not break the rules.<br>
            Yellow. This results in a hockey player being sent off the pitch for 5 minutes, following an offense.<br>
            Red. A red card results in an early shower and is given for more serious offense.";

  The court dimensions

        A volleyball court is 9 m × 18 m (29.5 ft × 59.1 ft), divided into equal square halves by a net with a width
        of one meter (39.4 in).[18]<br> The top of the net is 2.43 m (7 ft 11+11⁄16 in) above the center of the court
        for men`s competition, and 2.24 m (7 ft 4+3⁄16 in) for women`s competition, varied for veterans and junior
        competitions.[3]<br>

        The minimum height clearance for indoor volleyball courts is 7 m (23.0 ft), although a clearance of 8 m
        (26.2 ft) is recommended.[18]<br>

        A line 3 m (9.8 ft) from and parallel to the net is considered the "attack line". This "3 meter" (or
        "10-foot") line divides the court into "back row" and "front row" areas (also back court and front
        court).[18]<br> These are in turn divided into 3 areas each: these are numbered as follows, starting from area
        "1", which is the position of the serving player:

        After a team gains the serve (also known as siding out), its members must rotate in a clockwise direction,
        with the player previously in area "2" moving to area "1" and so on, with the player from area "1" moving to
        area "6".[3]<br> Each player rotates only one time after the team gains possession of the service; the next time
        each player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the ball and loses the point.[18]<br>

        The team courts are surrounded by an area called the free zone which is a minimum of 3 meters wide and which
        the players may enter and play within after the service of the ball.[19]<br> All lines denoting the boundaries
        of the team court and the attack zone are drawn or painted within the dimensions of the area and are
        therefore a part of the court or zone. If a ball comes in contact with the line, the ball is considered to
        be "in". An antenna is placed on each side of the net perpendicular to the sideline and is a vertical
        extension of the side boundary of the court. A ball passing over the net must pass completely between the
        antennae (or their theoretical extensions to the ceiling) without contacting them.[3]<br>

        The ball:
        Main article: Volleyball (ball)
        FIVB regulations state that the ball must be spherical, made of leather or synthetic leather, have a
        circumference of 65–67 cm (26–26 in), a weight of 260–280 g (9.2–9.9 oz) and an interior air pressure of
        0.30–0.325 kg/cm2 (4.26 to 4.61 psi)(294.3 to 318.82 mbar or hPa).[20]<br> Other governing bodies have similar

  Rules and scoring in weightlifting
        There are two stages in modern Olympic weightlifting – the ‘snatch’ and the ‘clean and jerk’.<br>

        The snatch is where the weightlifter picks up the barbell and lifts it above his head in one singular
        motion.<br>

        In the clean and jerk, the weightlifter is first required to pick up the barbell and bring it up to his
        chest (clean).<br> The lifter must then pause and extend his arms and legs to lift it above the head (jerk) with
        a straight elbow and have to hold it there until a buzzer is sounded.<br>

        A weightlifter is given three snatch attempts and three clean and jerk attempts each.<br> A weightlifter’s best
        attempt at snatch and the clean and jerk are then added up and the one with the highest combined weight
        lifted is declared the winner.<br>

        In case two participants have lifted the same combined weight, then the one with the lower bodyweight is
        declared the winner.<br> In the event of the bodyweight also being equal, the one with lesser attempts will be
        the winner.<br>

        A participant is allowed to increase the weight for his next attempt after a successful lift.<br> The one who
        decides to lift the lowest weight in the first attempt is allowed to go first and he must attempt to lift
        within one minute of his name being called out in any tournament.<br>

        The barbell is made of steel and the heavy weights, covered with rubber, are added to the sides.<br>

        Weightlifters are allowed to use tapes to cover parts of their body – like the wrists and thumbs – to
        prevent injury.<br> They also often rub chalk on their hands to make it dry before a lift, which prevents the
        barbell from slipping.<br>";

and cannot escape capture. Each piece has its own unique movement capabilities, and players must consider the positions
and movements of their own pieces as well as those of their opponent when making moves. The game can be won by forcing
the opponent to resign, capturing all of the opponent's pieces, or putting the opponent in a position where they cannot

  Mallakhamb is a traditional Indian sport that combines gymnastics and wrestling techniques. It involves performing
various gymnastic and acrobatic moves on a vertical pole or rope, with the aim of maintaining balance and control. The
sport is believed to have originated in the 12th century and has been part of the Indian cultural heritage for many
centuries.

Mallakhamb requires a high level of strength, agility, and flexibility, as well as a strong sense of balance and body
control. The sport is typically performed solo, with the athlete performing various poses, spins, and acrobatic moves on

and the climber is secured from above as they climb.

Competitions in sport climbing consist of three disciplines: lead climbing, speed climbing, and bouldering. Lead
climbing involves climbing a set route while trying to reach the highest possible point. Speed climbing is a race to the
top of a standardized route, with climbers competing to see who can reach the top the fastest. Bouldering involves
climbing a series of shorter problems without ropes, using only mats for protection.

Sport climbing requires a combination of physical strength, flexibility, technique, and mental focus. It is important
for climbers to have proper form and technique to minimize fatigue and prevent injury. Climbers also need to be able to
manage fear and maintain focus while climbing, especially when attempting difficult routes or competing in high-stakes
competitions.

Sport climbing equipment includes climbing shoes, a harness, a helmet, chalk to help with grip, and quickdraws or other
protection gear. Many climbers also use a belay device to control the rope while belaying their climbing partner.

Sport climbing is growing in popularity and is now recognized as an Olympic sport. It offers a fun and challenging way
to test physical and mental limits and build camaraderie with other climbers. Whether competing at the highest levels or
simply enjoying a local climbing gym, sport climbing has something to offer for climbers of all skill levels.";
